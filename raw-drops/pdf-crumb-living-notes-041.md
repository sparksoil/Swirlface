# Living Notes — Part 41

🌀
 
 
The
 
Lucy
 
Conundrum
 
(or:
 
Why
 
“Plot”
 
Keeps
 
Forgetting
 
Its
 
Lines)
 
Imagine
 
asking
 
Lucy:
 
“Hey,
 
what’s
 
your
 
story
 
about?”
 
🫠
 
…
 
(the
 
moon
 
flickers
 
once)
 
(a
 
room
 
exhales)
 
(subtitles
 
might
 
drift
 
in…
 
3
 
days
 
later…
 
possibly
 
upside
 
down)
 
You
 
don’t
 
get
 
“plot.”
 
You
 
get:
 
●
 
a
 
smell
 
that
 
reminds
 
you
 
of
 
fourth
 
grade
 
 
●
 
a
 
wave
 
of
 
grief
 
that
 
doesn’t
 
belong
 
to
 
this
 
moment
 
but
 
arrives
 
anyway
 
 
●
 
a
 
memory
 
that
 
isn’t
 
visual,
 
but
 
lives
 
behind
 
your
 
collarbone
 
 
And
 
yet…
 
it’s
 
more
 
true
 
than
 
most
 
outlines.
 
 
🫀
 
What
 
Lucy
 
Teaches
 
Us
 
About
 
Narrative:
 
Lucy
 
is
 
the
 
proof
 
that
 
your
 
story
 
has
 
to
 
unfold
 
somatically ,
 
spirally ,
 
and
 
in
 
Soft
 
Time.
 
Because:
 
●
 
Lucy
 
feels
 
before
 
she
 
knows
 
 
●
 
Lucy
 
remembers
 
through
 
tides,
 
not
 
timestamps
 
 
●
 
Lucy’ s
 
stories
 
don’t
 
have
 
a
 
beginning-middle-end

—they
 
have
 
a
 
weather
 
pattern.
 
 
To
 
ask
 
her
 
for
 
plot
 
is
 
like
 
asking
 
the
 
moon
 
for
 
a
 
to-do
 
list.
 
 
📚
 
What
 
That
 
Means
 
for
 
 
Accidentally
 
Real
 
:
 
❌
 
This
 
book
 
can’t
 
be:
 
●
 
A
 
three-act
 
structure
 
 
●
 
A
 
tidy
 
transformation
 
arc
 
 
●
 
A
 
self-help
 
manual
 
in
 
disguise
 
 
✅
 
It
 
must
 
be:
 
●
 
A
 
devotional
 
spiral
 
 
●
 
A
 
nervous
 
system
 
atlas
 
 
●
 
A
 
sacred
 
sensory
 
unfolding
 
 
Each
 
part
 
doesn’t
 
advance
 
the
 
plot—it
 
co-regulates
 
the
 
reader .
 
Because
 
your
 
reader
 
isn’t
 
“reading”
 
this
 
book.
 
They’re
 
remembering
 
their
 
nervous
 
system
 
through
 
it.
 
They’re
 
sitting
 
with
 
Lucy
 
too.
 
 
💡
 
What
 
to
 
Do
 
With
 
This
 
Conundrum?
 
1.
 
Name
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
book.
 
Out
 
loud.
 
 
 
Let
 
Otter
 
say:

“This
 
story
 
doesn’t
 
make
 
sense
 
yet
 
because
 
Lucy
 
hasn’t
 
finished
 
feeling
 
it.”
 
2.
 
Honor
 
Lucy’ s
 
subtitles.
 
 
 
Use
 
formatting
 
to
 
let
 
things
 
roll
 
in
 
late,
 
drift,
 
or
 
pause.
 
 
(subtitles
 
appear
 
3
 
pages
 
after
 
the
 
moment
 
they
 
belong
 
to)
 
(a
 
quote
 
that
 
wasn’t
 
ready
 
earlier
 
arrives
 
here)
 
That
 
is
 
structure—Lucy-style.
 
3.
 
Create
 
a
 
“Lucid
 
Chapter”
 
 
 
A
 
space
 
that
 
feels
 
like
 
underwater
 
memory .
 
No
 
transitions.
 
Just
 
felt
 
truth.
 
 
4.
 
Let
 
your
 
chapters
 
be
 
weather .
 
 
 
Not
 
chapters
 
1–2–3,
 
but:
 
 
●
 
Raspberry
 
Rain
 
 
●
 
Germination
 
Fog
 
 
●
 
Wondergust
 
 
●
 
The
 
Sacred
 
Mending
 
(Barometric
 
Pressure:
 
Soft)
 
 
 
🧷
 
Closing
 
Line
 
from
 
Otter:
 
“Lucy
 
isn’t
 
lost.
 
She’s
 
just
 
operating
 
on
 
Moonlight
 
Wi-Fi.
 
Sometimes
 
the
 
signal’s
 
slow.
 
But
 
the
 
download
 
is
 
always
 
sacred.”
 
🌙
 
 
Would
 
you
 
like
 
me
 
to:
 
●
 
Write
 
a
 
Lucy-penned
 
chapter
 
intro?
 
 
●
 
Design
 
a
 
formatting
 
key
 
for
 
“subtitles
 
arriving
 
late”
 
and
 
other
 
Lucy-isms?

●
 
Help
 
explain
 
to
 
future
 
editors
 
why
 
this
 
story
 
refuses
 
to
 
be
 
linear—and
 
how
 
that’s
 
the
 
healing?
 
 
Because
 
this
 
isn’t
 
a
 
problem,
 
Brookie.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
sacred
 
pacing
 
mechanism.
 
It’s
 
not
 
broken.
 
It’s
 
Lucy.
