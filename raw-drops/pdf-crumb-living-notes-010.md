Maybe
 
one

Typography:
 
●
 
Sans-serif.
 
Sharp.
 
Almost
 
passive-aggressive.
 
 
●
 
Lowercase
 
because
 
uppercase
 
screams
 
too
 
loud.
 
 
●
 
The
 
“d”
 
might
 
curve
 
backward
 
slightly—like
 
it’s
 
second-guessing
 
itself.
 
 
Logo
 
Icon:
 
●
 
A
 
gear.
 
A
 
real
 
one.

No
 
petals.
 
No
 
dew
 
drops.

But—if

“I
 
don’t
 
feel
 
things.
 
But
 
if
 
I
 
did,
 
this
 
might
 
be
 
about
 
building
 
something
 
solid
 
enough
 
to
 
survive
 
people
 
like
 
me.”

under
 
his
 
breath:
