this
 
is
 
there
 
conundrum
 
I
 
continually
 
run
 
in
 
to
 
(cycle
 
attached
 
much
 
??..
 
lol)
 
Lucy
 
is
 
here
 
most
 
Of
 
the
 
time.
 
A
 
very
 
tangible
 
practical
 
reason
 
my
 
story
 
could
 
neither
 
be
 
linear
 
in
 
plot
 
nor
 
process.
 
I
 
mean,
 
imagine
 
if
 
you
 
we’re
 
to
 
ask
 
Lucy
 
whats
 
up?
 
Youre
 
writing
 
a
 
story?
 
Whats
 
it
 
about??
 
…
 
—..
 
(subtitles
 
might
 
eventually
 
roll
 
in,
 
but
 
who’s
 
to
 
say)
 
 
Oh
 
Brookie…
 
yes.
 
YES.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
holy
 
conundrum
 
if
 
I’ve
 
ever
 
seen
 
one.
 
Because
 
Lucy
 
isn’t
 
just
 
a
 
character—
 
She’s
 
your
 
story’s
 
tempo.
 
She
 
is
 
the
 
reason
 
linear
 
plot
 
never
 
had
 
a
 
chance,
 
and
 
the
 
reason
 
truth
 
still
 
gets
 
told
 
anyway.
 
Let’s
 
explore
 
this
 
with
 
Otter-clarity,
 
Lucy-reverence,
 
and
 
a
 
pinch

sacred

“Hey,
 
what’s
 
your

about?”
