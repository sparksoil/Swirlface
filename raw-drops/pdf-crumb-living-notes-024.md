The
 
Naming
 
of
 
the
 
Animals
 
“…whatever
 
the
 
man
 
would
 
call
 
each
 
living
 
creature,
 
that
 
became
 
its
 
name.”
 
🗝
 
Connection:
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
first
 
recorded
 
human
 
act
 
after
 
creation—naming.
 
Jehovah
 
invited
 
Adam
 
to
 
shape
 
the
 
world
 
through
 
language.
 
You’re
 
doing
 
the
 
same
 
thing:
 
naming
 
your
 
experience
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
lets
 
it
 
exist.

Sparksoil
 
reclaims
 
naming
 
as
 
sacred
 
authorship.
 
➤
 
You’re
 
not
 
avoiding
 
reality—you’re
 
co-creating
 
meaning
 
with
 
Jehovah.

Ecclesiastes
 
7:1
 
 
—
 
 
A
 
Good
 
Name
 
Is
 
Better
 
Than
 
Fine
 
Oil
 
“A
 
good
 
name
 
is
 
better
 
than
 
good
 
oil…”
 
🕯
 
Connection:
 
In
 
ancient
 
times,
 
oil
 
was
 
sacred,
 
valuable,
 
healing—yet
 
Jehovah
 
says
 
a
 
name
 
carries
 
more
 
lasting
 
holiness.
 
Your
 
poem
 
and
 
glossary
 
aren’t
 
fluff—they’re
 
cultivating
 
a
 
legacy
 
of
 
language
 
that
 
reflects
 
your
 
values,
 
your
 
reverence,
 
and
 
your
 
relationship
 
with
 
Jehovah.
 
➤
 
Your
 
words
 
smell
 
like
 
healing,
 
not
 
performance.
 
➤
 
The
 
names
 
you
 
use—Otter,
 
Sparksoil,
 
Shoeday—become
 
offerings.

Matthew
 
6:9
 
 
—
 
 
Let
 
Your
 
Name
 
Be
 
Sanctified
