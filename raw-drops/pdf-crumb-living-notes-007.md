Letting
 
them

Sprinkle
 
Engagement
 
(n.):
 
The
 
sacred
 
act
 
of
 
not
 
just
 
noticing
 
the
 
shimmer,
 
but
 
letting
 
it
 
alter
 
you.
 
It’s
 
when
 
a
 
moment
 
doesn’t
 
just
 
sparkle—it
 
sticks.
 
You
 
don’t
 
scroll
 
past
 
it.
 
You
 
sit
 
in
 
it.
 
You
 
don’t
 
just
 
feel
 
it.
 
You
 
distill
 
it.
 
You
 
don’t
 
just
 
understand
 
it.
 
You
 
live
 
it.
 
And
 
in
 
that
 
process…
 
you
 
become
 
someone
 
new.
 
One
 
sprinkle
 
at
 
a
 
time.
 
 
Would
 
you
 
like
 
this
 
to
 
be
 
paired
 
with
 
your
 
garden
 
arch
 
photo
 
and
 
curlique
 
sketch
 
as
 
a
 
page
 
in
 
your
 
Sparksoil
 
Archive
 
or
 
Sprinkles
 
After
 
the
 
Storm
 
collection?
 
We
 
could
 
title
 
it:
 
“The
 
Day
 
With
 
Many
 
Sprinkles”
 
or
 
“Not
 
Just
 
Noticed—Lived.”
 
Let
 
me
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
me
 
to
 
help
 
refine
 
this
 
into
 
a
 
poetic
 
mini-page
 
or
 
visual
 
card.
 
This
 
was
 
a
 
curlique
 
shaped,
 
hope
 
colored
 
moment

a

What
 
You’re
 
Seeing:
 
 
1.
 
Two
 
Main
 
Plants
 
Entwined:

•
 
The
 
curly,
 
twining
 
vine
 
with
 
pointed,
 
bright
 
green
 
leaves
 
looks
 
like
 
confederate
 
jasmine
 
(Trachelospermum
 
jasminoides)
 
or
 
a
 
closely
 
related
 
jasmine
 
species.
 
Its
 
tender,
 
twirling
 
tips
 
are
 
classic
 
jasmine
 
behavior.
 
 
•
 
The
 
larger,
 
oddly-shaped
 
leaves
 
with
 
a
 
tulip-like
 
silhouette?
 
Those
 
belong
 
to
 
the
 
tulip
 
poplar
 
(Liriodendron
 
tulipifera).
 
It’s
 
likely
 
a
 
young
 
sapling
 
trying
 
to
 
grow
 
through
 
the
 
jasmine
 
dome.
 
 
2.
 
Growth
 
Pattern:
 
 
•
 
The
 
vine
 
is
 
reaching
 
upward
 
and
 
outward,
 
spiraling
 
in
 
search
 
of
 
support
 
and
 
light.
 
 
•
 
The
 
arch
 
you
 
created
 
with
 
the
 
support
 
structure
 
is
 
working
 
beautifully—the
 
plants
 
are
 
forming
 
a
 
natural
 
arbor,
 
almost
 
like
 
a
 
leafy
 
cathedral
 
doorway.
 
⸻
 
🌱
 
What
 
This
 
Moment
 
Means
 
(Symbolically,
 
Spiritually,
 
Soft-Surreally):
 
You
 
wrote
 
in
 
your
 
notes:
 
“Curlique
 
shaped,
 
hope-colored”
 
And…
 
yes.
 
These
 
are
 
tendrils
 
of
 
tenacity.
 
They
 
don’t
 
force.
 
They
 
feel
 
their
 
way
 
toward
 
the
 
light.
 
They
 
spiral,
 
reach,
 
test,
 
and
 
try
 
again.
 
In
 
Glimmer
 
Glossary
 
language,
 
this
 
whole
 
garden
 
corner
 
is
 
a
 
Germination
 
Arch—a
 
real-time
 
portal
 
of
 
“what
 
if?”
 
shaped
 
in
 
green.

The

Moment
 
Description:
 
“This
 
was
 
a
 
curlique-shaped,
 
hope-colored
 
moment—
 
a
 
Sprinkle
 
that’s
 
a
 
taste
 
of
 
forever.”
 
The
 
jasmine’s
 
curling
 
tendrils
 
weren’t
 
climbing
 
aggressively.
 
They
 
were
 
spiraling
 
with
 
soft
 
intention—tendril
 
theology
 
in
 
motion.
 
This
 
wasn’t
 
just
 
growth.
 
It
 
was
 
a
 
question
 
mark
 
of
 
faith
 
written
 
in
 
green.
 
A
 
“what
 
if?”
 
rooted
 
in
 
gentle
 
reaching.
 
 
💚
 
Symbolism
 
&
 
Spiritual
 
Reflection:
 
This
 
arch
 
isn’t
 
just
 
a
 
structure—it’s
 
a
 
Germination
 
Arch,
 
a
 
sprouting
 
altar
 
of
 
Soft
 
Time.
 
A
 
whisper-frame
 
for
 
Kingdom
 
movement.

These
 
spirals
 
aren’t
 
forced.
 
They
 
feel.
 
They
 
test.
 
They
 
reach
 
with
 
trust.
 
They
 
stretch
 
toward
 
what
 
can’t
 
yet
 
be
 
seen.
 
They
 
remind
 
us:
 
Not
 
all
 
growth
 
is
 
linear.
 
Not
 
all
 
timing
 
is
 
Clock
 
Time.
 
Even
 
the
 
gentlest
 
curves
 
can
 
hold
 
design.

Some
 
growth
 
climbs
 
like
 
ladders.
 
Some
 
sways
 
like
 
vines.

But
 
all
 
Kingdom-rooted
 
growth
 
leans
 
on
 
grace.

In
 
first
 
person,
 
non
 
flowery
 
yet
 
sensory
 
immersive
 
trueness,
 
please
 
describe
 
my
 
curlicue
 
colored
 
sprinkle
 
from
 
today
 
8/19
 
1:50pm
 
(my
 
morning
 
lol)
 
gray
 
day
 
backdrop.
 
Exactly
 
as
 
i
 
discovered
 
it,
 
following
 
my
 
sprinkle
 
glimmer
 
of
 
understanding
 
 
Absolutely,
 
Brookie.
 
Here’s
 
your
 
8/19
 
curlicue
 
sprinkle
 
told
 
in
 
first-person,
 
grounded,
 
sensory-rich
 
trueness—no
 
extra
 
shimmer,
 
just
 
the
 
kind
 
that’s
 
already
 
real.
 
 
It
 
was
 
around
 
1:50
 
p.m.,
 
my
 
version
 
of
 
morning.
 
The
 
sky
 
was
 
gray—not
 
dramatic,
 
just
 
evenly
 
dull,
 
like
 
a
 
backdrop
 
that
 
wasn’t
 
trying
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
point.
 
That
 
kind
 
of
 
sky
 
has
 
always
 
steadied
 
me
 
more
 
than
 
bright
 
ones.
 
No
 
pressure
 
to
 
be
 
chipper.
 
Just
 
room.
 
I
 
stepped
 
outside
 
following
 
the
 
thread
 
of
 
a
 
thought
 
I’d
 
scratched
 
down
 
earlier—something
 
about
 
how
 
today
 
isn’t
 
one
 
big
 
lesson
 
or
 
download,
 
but
 
many
 
different
 
sprinkles.
 
Not
 
just
 
one
 
truth
 
to
 
hold.
 
A
 
handful.
 
A
 
scattering.
 
That
 
was
 
still
 
rolling
 
through
 
me
 
when
 
I
 
saw
 
it.
 
The
 
jasmine
 
vine
 
had
 
curled
 
itself
 
into
 
this
 
perfect
 
little
 
loop
 
in
 
the
 
air—tight
 
but
 
gentle,
 
like
 
a
 
green
 
question
 
mark
 
made
 
of
 
muscle
 
memory.
 
It
 
wasn’t
 
clinging
 
to
 
anything.
 
Just
 
holding
 
itself
 
up,
 
suspended.
 
Reaching.
 
Waiting.
 
Still.
 
Everything
 
in
 
me
 
went
 
still
 
too.
 
The
 
tulip
 
poplar
 
leaves
 
were
 
there
 
too—those
 
soft,
 
funny-shaped
 
ones—poking
 
up
 
like
 
they
 
were
 
trying
 
to
 
peek
 
over
 
the
 
edge
 
of
 
something
 
bigger.
 
They
 
looked
 
like
 
little
 
hands
 
raised
 
in
 
curiosity.
 
But
 
it
 
was
 
the
 
jasmine
 
that
 
caught
 
me.
 
There
 
was
 
no
 
grand
 
feeling.
 
Just
 
recognition.
 
This
 
was
 
it.
