# Living Notes — Part 22

and
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
sandcastle
 
that
 
sang
 
lullabies
 
(but
 
only
 
every
 
other
 
Tuesday).
 
She
 
tried
 
to
 
tell
 
her
 
grandma.
 
But
 
the
 
words
 
got
 
stuck.
 
Otter
 
understood.
 
He
 
didn’t
 
ask
 
questions.
 
He
 
just
 
hummed.
 
Held
 
the
 
pebble.
 
And
 
nodded
 
like
 
the
 
dream
 
was
 
still
 
happening.
 
 
At
 
school,
 
they
 
gave
 
her
 
a
 
plate.
 
“A
 
keepsake!”
 
the
 
teacher
 
beamed.
 
“Draw
 
your
 
best
 
picture—your
 
family
 
will
 
keep
 
it
 
forever.”
 
Kitty
 
wanted
 
to
 
draw
 
something
 
wonderful.
 
So
 
she
 
looked
 
around.
 
Rainbows.
 
Puppies.
 
Families
 
under
 
trees.
 
Each
 
picture
 
tidy.
 
One
 
idea.
 
But
 
Kitty’s
 
head
 
was
 
a
 
full-blown
 
Kitebrain—
 
colors,
 
ideas,
 
and
 
tugging
 
truths
 
all
 
flapping
 
against
 
each
 
other
 
in
 
the
 
wind.
 
She
 
couldn’t
 
pick
 
just
 
one.
 
So
 
she
 
drew
 
all
 
of
 
them.
