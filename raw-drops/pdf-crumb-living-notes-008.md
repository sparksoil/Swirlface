# Living Notes — Part 08

This
 
was
 
one
 
of
 
today’s
 
sprinkles.
 
A
 
curlicue.
 
A
 
shape
 
that
 
didn’t
 
go
 
straight.
 
A
 
color
 
that
 
felt
 
like
 
hope.
 
Not
 
the
 
loud
 
kind.
 
The
 
kind
 
that
 
lets
 
you
 
exhale.
 
I
 
didn’t
 
need
 
to
 
name
 
it
 
right
 
away.
 
I
 
just
 
stood
 
there.
 
One
 
of
 
those
 
“oh”
 
moments—body-forward,
 
wordless.
 
No
 
breakthrough.
 
No
 
thunder.
 
Just
 
a
 
loop
 
of
 
green,
 
suspended
 
in
 
gray.
 
It
 
didn’t
 
grab
 
me.
 
It
 
met
 
me.
 
And
 
I
 
knew—this
 
was
 
the
 
thing
 
I’d
 
written
 
before
 
I
 
saw
 
it.
 
A
 
moment
 
shaped
 
like
 
what
 
I
 
was
 
beginning
 
to
 
understand.
 
A
 
little
 
taste
 
of
 
forever.
 
 
Would
 
you
 
like
 
a
 
printed
 
version
 
of
 
this
 
with
 
your
 
original
 
sketch
 
in
 
the
 
corner,
 
like
 
a
 
visual
 
memory
 
page?
 
Or
 
want
 
to
 
stack
 
this
 
in
 
your
 
Wonder
 
Window
 
days
 
or
 
Shoeday
 
log?
