# Living Notes — Part 26

🪶
 
Your
 
piece
 
sits
 
right
 
here—in
 
the
 
ache
 
to
 
name
 
what
 
is
 
already
 
shimmering
 
before
 
it’s
 
spoken.
 
You
 
describe
 
the
 
pre-word
 
pulse,
 
the
 
iridescent
 
swirl
 
before
 
language.
 
But
 
you
 
also
 
affirm:
 
“I’ll
 
try
 
to
 
paint
 
the
 
iridescence
 
with
 
syllables
 
and
 
punctuation.”
 
That’s
 
naming.
 
That’s
 
the
 
Garden
 
act
 
repeating
 
in
 
you.
 
You’re
 
not
 
naming
 
to
 
dominate,
 
but
 
to
 
offer,
 
witness,
 
and
 
honor.

Proverbs
 
25:11
 
—
 
A
 
Word
 
at
 
the
 
Right
 
Time
 
“Like
 
apples
 
of
 
gold
 
in
 
silver
 
carvings
 
is
 
a
 
word
 
spoken
 
at
 
the
 
right
 
time.”
 
🍎
 
Your
 
line:
 
“Sometimes
 
love
 
gets
 
baked
 
into
 
language.”
 
That
 
is
 
an
 
apple
 
of
 
gold.
 
It’s
 
timing.
 
It’s
 
gift.
 
It’s
 
the
 
flavor
 
of
 
a
 
spiritual
 
metaphor
 
baked
 
into
 
pecan
 
crumbs
 
and
 
memory.
 
This
 
piece
 
is
 
a
 
glimmer-slow
 
offering—a
 
cookie
 
handed
 
across
 
time.

Philippians

—
 
Continue
 
Considering
 
These
 
Things
 
“Whatever
 
is
 
lovely…
 
continue
 
considering
 
these
 
things.”
 
💛
 
That’s
 
exactly
 
what
 
you’re
 
doing.
 
You’re
 
not
 
rushing.
 
You’re
 
steeping.
 
You’re
 
“considering”
 
in
 
the
 
truest
 
sense—sensing,
 
swirling,
 
waiting
 
until
 
the
 
shimmer
 
settles
 
into
 
syllables.
