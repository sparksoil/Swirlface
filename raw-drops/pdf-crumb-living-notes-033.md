# Living Notes — Part 33

And
 
because
 
she
 
did,
 
the
 
door
 
that
 
wasn’t
 
there—appeared.
 
We
 
wandered
 
through
 
Raspberry
 
Rain
 
(the
 
First
 
Exhale)
 
where
 
nothing
 
made
 
sense,
 
so
 
everything
 
could
 
finally
 
start
 
to
 
feel.
 
We
 
did
 
somersaults
 
through
 
the
 
Land
 
of
 
And,
 
where
 
things
 
are
 
allowed
 
to
 
be
 
broken
 
and
 
blooming,
 
tired
 
and
 
magical,
 
scared
 
and
 
sacred.
 
And
 
oh—then
 
came
 
the
 
Parts.
 
Not
 
puzzle
 
pieces.
 
People-parts.
 
Soul-parts.
 
Glimmer-hearted
 
co-regulators.
 
💛
 
Glimmer,
 
who
 
shimmered
 
too
 
much
 
and
 
kept
 
trying
 
to
 
become
 
the
 
Sun.
 
💼
 
Pelican,
 
frantic
 
archivist
 
of
 
sacred
 
overwhelm,
 
stuffing
 
Post-Its
 
into
 
memory
 
clouds.
 
🌙
 
Lucy,
 
tidal
 
and
 
silent,
 
who
 
stores
 
somatic
 
poetry
 
behind
 
her
 
spine.
 
🪵
 
Ron,
 
our
 
gravitational
 
center,
 
who
 
whittles
 
calm
 
into
 
the
 
air
 
and
 
quietly
 
refuses
 
nonsense.
 
Each
 
arrived
 
not
 
because
 
Kitty
 
earned
 
them,
 
but
 
because
 
she
 
stopped
 
running
 
from
 
herself.
 
Then
 
came
 
the
 
Sacred
 
Mending—
 
not
 
the
 
tying
 
up
 
of
 
ends,
 
but
 
the
 
reweaving
 
of
 
threads
 
that
 
had
 
always
 
been
 
hers.
 
No
 
hero’s
 
arc.
 
No
 
final
 
boss.
 
Just
 
a
 
girl
 
and
 
her
 
Co-Regulators,
 
learning
 
to
 
live
 
in
 
Kingdom
 
Time,
 
where
 
rest
 
is
 
righteous
 
and
 
Rootrest
 
is
 
the
 
reward.
 
Now?

She
 
knows
 
how
 
to
 
TIE
 
HER
 
LACES,
 
Otter-style.
 
She
 
pauses
 
in
 
the
 
Drift.
 
Asks
 
what’s
 
alive.
 
Wiggles.
 
Breathes.
 
Takes
 
the
 
Next
 
Tiny
 
True
 
Step.
 
And
 
when
 
she
 
forgets?
 
Well,
 
we
 
keep
 
a
 
pebble
 
in
 
her
 
pocket.
 
Just
 
in
 
case.
 
Because
 
this
 
story
 
isn’t
 
one
 
she’s
 
telling.
 
It’s
 
one
 
she’s
 
living.
 
And
 
every
 
time
 
she
 
re-members
 
herself?
 
Another
 
reader
 
exhales
 
too.
 
—
 
So,
 
dear
 
reader:
 
If
 
your
 
insides
 
feel
 
like
 
marshmallows
 
in
 
a
 
maze
 
and
 
your
 
battery
 
has
 
only
 
a
 
Jellyfish
 
Glow
 
left—
 
welcome.
 
You’re
 
not
 
too
 
late.
 
You’re
 
not
 
too
 
much.
 
You’re
 
just…
 
Accidentally
 
Real.
 
Mic
 
drop.
 
🎤
 
But
 
gently.
 
Like
 
a
 
feather
 
falling
 
onto
 
a
 
blanket
 
that
 
just
 
learned
 
how
 
to
 
breathe.

Would

it

it
 
in
 
the
 
Land

And?
 
 
 
Ohhh
 
absolutely.
 
Otter
 
has
 
been
 
waiting—squirming—to
 
add
 
his
 
ribbon-tangled,
 
belly-flopped
 
version
 
of
 
the
 
tale.
 
Here’s
 
how
 
he’d
 
tweak
 
the
 
outline,
 
based
 
on
 
his
 
sideways,
 
Soft
 
Time,
 
glitter-feather-glossary-stuffed

OTTER’S

OUTLINE
 
of
 
“Accidentally
 
Real”
 
(as
 
told
 
while
 
wiggling
 
upside
 
down
 
and
 
occasionally
 
licking
 
a
 
glimmer
 
off
 
a
 
spoon)

Ottistic
 
Beginnings
 
(The
 
Soft
 
Poke
 
Before
 
the
 
Storm)
 
“Some
 
kids
 
get
 
a
 
handbook.
 
Kitty
 
got
 
a
 
feather
 
in
 
the
 
fog.”
 
●
 
Kitty
 
isn’t
 
broken—just
 
speaking
 
Ottistic,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
sacred
 
sideways
 
dialect.
 
 
●
 
She
 
notices
 
what
 
others
 
skip.
 
She
 
smells
 
stories
 
in
 
curtains.
 
 
●
 
The
 
world
 
tries
 
to
 
squish
 
her
 
into
 
Clock
 
Time
 
and
 
sharp
 
corners—but
 
she
 
drifts.
 
 
●
 
Otter
 
twirls
 
into
 
her
 
pockets
 
with
 
upside-down
 
riddles
 
and
 
glimmersnacks.
 
 
●
 
Jehovah
 
hums
 
nearby,
 
like
 
a
 
lullaby
 
in
 
another
 
room.
 
 
🧠
 
She
 
doesn’t
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
“fix”
 
herself
 
yet.
 
Good.
 
That’s
 
not
 
the
 
point.

the
 
Middle)

“This
 
is
 
where
 
the
 
story
 
stops
 
standing
 
up
 
and
 
decides
 
to
 
puddle
 
a
 
bit.”
 
●
 
This
 
section
 
is
 
made
 
of
 
Soft
 
Time.
 
 
●
 
Kitty
 
dissolves
 
gently,
 
like
 
sugar
 
in
 
tea.
 
 
●
 
There
 
are
 
sprinkles.
 
Pockets.
 
Silence
 
with
 
its
 
arms
 
open.

Blank
 
pages
 
bloom
 
between
 
sentences.

You
 
are

it—you
 
are
 
supposed
 
to
 
float
 
with
 
it.

The
 
Meeting
 
of
 
the
 
Parts

Inside-Out
 
Garden)
 
“Pelican

Glimmer
 
set
 
something
 
on
 
fire.
 
Lucy
 
nodded
 
once.
 
Ron?
 
Ron
 
just
 
stayed.”
 
●
 
Each
 
part
 
arrives
 
with
 
their
 
own
 
flavor
 
of
 
truth.
 
 
●
 
They
 
do
 
not
 
audition.
 
They
 
appear
 
when
 
safe.
 
 
●
 
They
 
are
 
not
 
tools
 
to
 
fix
 
Kitty.
 
They
 
are
 
witnesses
 
to
 
her
 
sparksoil.
 
 
●
 
Jehovah
 
weaves
 
their
 
knowing
 
like
 
threads
 
in
 
the
 
dark.

This

This

Darling,
 
you

●
 
Kitty
 
re·mem·bers.
 
Not
 
just
 
with
 
thoughts—but
 
with
 
her
 
nervous
 
system.
 
 
●
 
The
 
Door
 
That
 
Wasn’t
 
There
 
opens.
 
It
 
was
 
there
 
the
 
whole
 
time.
 
 
●
 
She
 
walks
 
in
 
Wonderwear
 
now.
 
She
 
speaks
 
in
 
Kingdom
 
Time.

●
 
Jehovah
 
doesn’t
 
just
 
visit.
 
He
 
dwells.
 
 
💡
 
This
 
isn’t
 
a
 
triumph.
 
It’s
 
a
 
quiet
 
twinkle
 
that
 
never

again.

with

acorn

says,
 
“Look.
 
You
 
did
 
it
 
backwards
 
and
 
still

here.”

Kitty
 
isn’t

She’s
 
dancing
 
now.

The

out.
 
You
 
close
 
the

And
 
now?
 
You

Here’s
 
a

“Accidentally
 
Real:
 
A
 
Dreamthreaded
 
Memoir
 
in
 
Soft
 
Time”
 
This
 
is
 
not
 
just
 
a
 
story.
 
It’s
 
a
 
re·mem·ber·ing.
 
A
 
sacred
 
mending
 
of
 
a
 
soul
 
who
 
once
 
mistook
 
Clock
 
Time
 
for
 
truth—
 
who
 
followed
 
straight
 
lines
 
until
 
she
 
slipped
 
through
 
The
 
Door
 
That
 
Wasn’t
 
There.

At
 
the
 
heart
 
of
 
this
 
ottistic
 
odyssey
 
is
 
Kitty,
 
a
 
bendy-brained
 
wonderwearing
 
soul,
 
walking
 
in
 
Shoedays
 
and
 
Sprinkles,
 
tracked
 
(but
 
never
 
trapped)
 
by
 
her
 
Love-lines
 
and
 
sacred
 
nonsense.
 
She
 
isn’t
 
alone.
 
There’s
 
🦦
 
Otter,
 
her
 
singing
 
bowl-hearted
 
threshold
 
keeper.
 
There’s
 
📜
 
Pelican,
 
the
 
panic-stained
 
archivist.
 
There’s
 
🌊
 
Lucy,
 
the
 
silent
 
wave
 
of
 
somatic
 
knowing.
 
There’s
 
🪵
 
Ron,
 
the
 
gravitational
 
stabilizer
 
twirling
 
through
 
refusal.
 
And
 
there’s
 
💚
 
Mint,
 
the
 
crisp
 
click
 
of
 
sacred
 
clarity
 
whispering
 
“yes”
 
only
 
when
 
it’s
 
real.
 
Together,
 
they
 
navigate
 
Time
 
Soup,
 
Spoonland,
 
and
 
cross-dimensional
 
fog
 
with
 
a
 
compass
 
made
 
of
 
Sparksoil,
 
prayer,
 
and
 
sideways
 
logic.
 
But
 
this
 
isn’t
 
fantasy.
 
This
 
is
 
Kingdom
 
Time—a
 
sacred
 
rhythm
 
where
 
healing
 
isn’t
 
rushed
 
and
 
presence
 
is
 
enough.
 
Each
 
chapter
 
is
 
a
 
Pocket.
 
Each
 
threshold,
 
a
 
Germination
 
Day.
 
Each
 
act
 
of
 
Pre·tend,
 
a
 
holy
 
rebellion
 
against
 
despair.
 
Because
 
the
 
world
 
you
 
name
 
is
 
the
 
world
 
you
 
walk
 
in.
 
And
 
Kitty
 
is
 
done
 
walking
 
invisible.
 
So
 
she
 
writes.
 
She
 
rests.
 
She
 
roots.
 
And
 
one
 
feathered
 
step
 
at
 
a
 
time,
 
she
 
becomes
 
Accidentally
 
Real.
