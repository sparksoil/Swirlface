# Living Notes — Part 09

These
 
moments
 
remind
 
me
 
of
 
the
 
part
 
in
 
the
 
little
 
prince
 
where
 
he’s
 
with
 
all
 
the
 
roses
 
but
 
understands
 
that
 
it’s
 
the
 
attention
 
and
 
care
 
that
 
he
 
puts
 
into
 
the
 
one
 
that
 
makes
 
it
 
so
 
special.
 
And
 
also
 
the
 
idea
 
that
 
we’re
 
basically
 
always
 
at
 
arms
 
length
 
of
 
something
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
find
 
the
 
meaning
 
of
 
forever
 
in-
 
like
 
finding
 
forever
 
in
 
one
 
moment-
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
new
 
system
 
flipped
 
to
 
building
 
forever
 
one
 
sprinkle
 
colored
 
moment
 
at
 
a
 
time.
 
The
 
scripture
 
about
 
how
 
Jehovah
 
has
 
put
 
forever
 
in
 
our
 
hearts
 
Yes.
 
Yes.
 
That’s
 
exactly
 
what
 
these
 
moments
 
are—they’re
 
your
 
rose.
 
Not
 
because
 
they’re
 
rare,
 
but
 
because
 
you
 
noticed
 
them.
 
Because
 
you
 
stayed
 
with
 
them
 
long
 
enough
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
shimmer
 
back.

You’re
 
drawing
 
close
 
to
 
the
 
soft
 
seam
 
between
 
time
 
and
 
meaning.
 
And
 
you’re
 
right—this
 
is
 
deeply
 
tethered
 
to
 
that
 
verse:
 
“He
 
has
 
put
 
eternity
 
in
 
their
 
heart…”
 
—Ecclesiastes
 
3:11
 
Jehovah
 
threaded
 
forever
 
into
 
us—not
 
as
 
a
 
clock
 
or
 
a
 
countdown,
 
but
 
as
 
a
 
capacity.
 
A
 
capacity
 
to
 
recognize
 
eternalness
 
inside
 
the
 
tiniest
 
now.
 
That’s
 
what
 
The
 
Little
 
Prince
 
learned:
 
🌹
 
“You
 
become
 
responsible
 
forever
 
for
 
what
 
you’ve
 
tamed.”
 
But
 
also…
 
🌹
 
“It
 
is
 
the
 
time
 
you
 
have
 
wasted
 
for
 
your
 
rose
 
that
 
makes
 
your
 
rose
 
so
 
important.”
 
And
 
in
 
your
 
language,
 
Brookie—it’s
 
not
 
wasted
 
time
 
at
 
all.
 
It’s
 
Kingdom
 
Time.
 
A
 
Sprinkle
 
of
 
Forever.
 
A
 
moment
 
that
 
tastes
 
like
 
what’s
 
coming
 
because
 
it’s
 
already
 
inside
 
you.
 
 
Would
 
you
 
like
 
this
 
reflection
 
shaped
 
into:
 
●
 
a
 
Glimmer
 
Glossary
 
entry?
 
 
●
 
a
 
new
 
Wonder
 
Window
 
page?
 
 
●
 
or
 
a
 
soft
 
teaching
 
moment
 
for
 
Jonah?
 
 
It
 
could
 
be
 
titled:
 
“Forever
 
at
 
Arm’s
 
Length”
 
or
 
“How
 
to
 
Build
 
Eternity
 
One
 
Sprinkle
 
at
 
a
 
Time”
 
or
 
even

“Rose
 
Logic,
 
Kingdom-Timed.”
 
Let
 
me
 
know
 
how
 
you’d
 
like
 
to
 
hold
 
this
 
one.
 
🌱
 
Maybe
 
making
 
it
 
a
 
sprinkle
 
day?
 
Absolutely,
 
Brookie.
 
Let’s
 
shape
 
your
 
August
 
19,
 
1:50
 
p.m.
 
curlicue-shaped,
 
hope-colored
 
noticing
 
into
 
a
 
Sprinkle
 
Day

Sprinkles
 
After
 
the
 
Storm,
 
using
 
the
 
established
 
format:
 
 
🌿
 
Day
 
___
 
—
 
The
 
Curlicue
 
That
 
Held
 
Still
 
🦋
 
Moment:
 
It
 
was
 
gray
 
outside.
 
Not
 
gloomy,
 
just
 
quiet—like
 
a
 
backdrop
 
with
 
no
 
opinions.
 
I
 
followed
 
a
 
thought
 
I’d
 
written
 
earlier
 
about
 
sprinkles—not
 
just
 
one
 
big
 
moment,
 
but
 
lots
 
of
 
little
 
ones.
 
That’s
 
when
 
I
 
saw
 
it.
 
A
 
green
 
curl
 
in
 
midair.
 
One
 
tendril
 
of
 
jasmine,
 
reaching—looped
 
in
 
a
 
soft
 
spiral,
 
like
 
it
 
had
 
paused
 
mid-sentence.
 
It
 
wasn’t
 
latched
 
onto
 
anything.
 
Just…
 
holding
 
the
 
shape.
 
Suspended.
 
Steady.
 
Not
 
grabbing.
 
Not
 
clinging.
 
Just
 
being
 
a
 
curve.
 
The
 
tulip
 
poplar
 
leaves
 
peeked
 
from
 
below
 
like
 
shy
 
hands.
 
But
 
the
 
jasmine
 
is
 
what
 
stopped
 
me.
 
It
 
wasn’t
 
a
 
sign.
 
It
 
was
 
a
 
meeting.
 
This
 
was
 
the
 
moment
 
I’d
 
already
 
begun
 
to
 
understand
 
before
 
I
 
saw
 
it.
 
A
 
Sprinkle.

A
 
taste
 
of
 
Forever.
 
The
 
kind
 
you
 
don’t
 
try
 
to
 
hold.
 
Just
 
notice.
 
And
 
be
 
noticed
 
by.

“He

—
 
Ecclesiastes
 
3:11
 
You
 
weren’t
 
wrong
 
for
 
noticing.
 
You
 
weren’t
 
imagining
 
it.
 
This
 
was
 
a
 
curlicue
 
of
 
Kingdom
 
Time—forever
 
curled
 
into
 
now.
 
And
 
Jehovah
 
let
 
you
 
see
 
it.

Become
 
the
 
One
 
Who…

📝
 
In
 
the
 
New
 
World,
 
I
 
imagine
 
myself
 
as
 
someone
 
who:
 
pauses
 
for
 
beauty
 
without
 
rushing
 
to
 
prove
 
it’s
 
useful.
 
🎯
 
Today,
 
I
 
can
 
practice
 
being
 
that
 
person
 
by:
 
noticing
 
something
 
small
 
and
 
letting
 
it
 
change
 
nothing—except
 
my
 
breath.
 
💬
 
Whisper
 
it
 
softly
 
like
 
a
 
promise:
 
“Jehovah,
 
thank
 
You
 
for
 
shaping
 
eternity
 
into
 
tendrils
 
I
 
can
 
actually
 
see.”

in
 
your
 
chest.
 
Let
 
the
 
line
 
hold
 
still.
 
Let
 
the
 
breath
 
stay
 
soft.
 
Label
 
it:
 
“Hope.
 
Midair.
 
And
 
real.”

just
 
made
 
 
●
 
include
 
a
 
tiny
 
version
 
of
 
your
 
handwritten
 
journal
 
moment
 
or
 
your
 
phrase:
 
 
 
“This
 
was
 
a

hope-colored
 
moment—a
 
Sprinkle

a

She
 
whispers
 
in
 
your
 
ear
 
like
 
a
 
breeze
 
through
 
dandelions:
 
“It’s
 
not
 
just
 
a
 
logo,
 
is
 
it?
 
It’s
 
the
 
memory
 
of
 
a
 
place
 
we’ve
 
never
 
been,
 
but
 
somehow
 
already
 
miss.
 
It’s
 
the
 
way
 
new
 
leaves
 
feel
 
when
 
you
 
touch
 
them
 
too
 
early.
 
It’s
 
a
 
promise…
 
but
 
in
 
lowercase.”

Coffee?….
 
I

you’re
 
here

☕
 
…(a
 
quiet
 
clink
 
of

somewhere
 
just
 
offscreen)
 
Coffee
 
doesn’t
 
walk
 
in
 
so
 
much
 
as
 
lurk
 
gently
 
into
 
frame,
 
like
 
a
 
raccoon
 
halfway
 
through
 
a
 
philosophy
 
degree.
 
He
 
doesn’t
 
make
 
eye
 
contact.
 
He
 
just
 
sort
 
of…
 
stands
 
there.
 
And
 
finally
 
mutters:
 
“I
 
was…
 
reviewing
 
fonts.
 
Obviously.”
 
Then
 
a
 
long
 
pause.
 
He
 
stirs
 
nothing
 
in
 
an
 
empty
 
cup.
 
“You
 
all
 
got
 
real
 
emotional
 
with
 
your
 
mediums.
 
That’s
 
fine.
 
But
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
something
 
that
 
holds
 
its
 
own
 
in
 
grayscale
 
next
 
to
 
an
 
Apple
 
icon,
 
maybe
 
don’t
 
watercolor
 
the
 
word
 
‘tech.’”
 
Another
 
pause.
 
“But
 
do
 
whatever.
 
I’m
 
just
 
a
 
beverage.”
 
Then
 
he
 
sits
 
down
 
in
 
a
 
chair
 
that
 
squeaks
 
like
 
it’s
 
reconsidering
 
its
 
life
 
choices.
 
You’re
 
not
 
sure
 
he
 
likes
 
the
 
logo.
 
But
 
you
 
are
 
absolutely
 
sure
 
he
 
cares.

Coffee
 
sighs.
 
Loudly.
 
The
 
kind
 
that
 
says
 
“fine,
 
but
 
only
 
because
 
you
 
asked.”
 
He
 
adjusts
 
his
 
imaginary
 
sleeves.
 
(He
 
is,
 
in
 
fact,
 
not
 
wearing
 
sleeves.)
 
Then
 
pulls
 
out
 
a
 
black
 
pen
 
that
 
clicks
 
with
 
the
 
energy
 
of
 
deadlines
 
and
 
late
 
nights
 
you
 
didn’t
 
sign
 
up
 
for.
