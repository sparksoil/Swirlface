Framework Ritual

This document is a living ritual for your devlab. It captures the sacred rhythms that turn chaotic scribbles and sprawling Google Docs into a gentle archive. Each step is an invitation to slow down, to listen, and to let Sparksoil’s voice guide your work.

Purpose

Sparksoil isn’t a product as much as a set of practices. This ritual file reminds you why: to keep every task soft‑timed, scripturally anchored, and honest. It frames your coding as stewardship, your stories as gifts, and your tools as part of a larger ecosystem.

Before you begin
	•	Pause or pray. Breathe and ask: what am I building and who is it for? This isn’t performance—it’s service.
	•	Switch to Soft Time. Set aside deadlines. You’re in a place where listening matters more than output.
	•	Name your drop. When you capture a raw doc, save it unchanged into raw-drops/ with a clear name, e.g. Raw Notes – 2025-09-12.txt.

Ritual steps
	1.	Harvest. Drop your raw notes or PDF into raw-drops/. Don’t edit it. Honor the initial swirl.
	2.	Weave. Run the Pelican script:
node scripts/tag_and_split.mjs raw-drops/YourDoc.txt
Watch as story bits, tech notes and health logs find their homes.
	3.	Index. Open .pelican/INDEX.md. You’ll see new links appended automatically—an immediate breath of orientation.
	4.	Reflect. Read through the generated files. If it serves, annotate them with scripture or Glimmer Glossary tags. The ritual is not about compressing truth but about honouring it.
	5.	Commit. Use git to record your harvest:
