# 🥿 Shoeday Checklist — Jonah’s Swirl School (Agent Mode)

Tiny compass for when spoons are low.  
Agent = gardener, Codex = sketchbook, Pelican = archivist.

---

## 🌱 Step Rhythm

1. **Pick Phase**
   - Choose next roadmap phase (1–5).
   - Mint check: “Does this matter now?”

2. **Make Branch**
   - Name playful: `phase-2-swirlfeed`, `lucy-nap-test`, `otter-sparkle`.
   - Main stays safe.

3. **Hand Agent One Feature**
   - Bundle files if linked (HTML + CSS + JS).
   - Example:  
     > Agent, open `swirlfeed.js` and `swirlfeed.css`. Add scroll feed view. Commit as `F: Swirlfeed scroll view`.

4. **Test in Browser**
   - Refresh page → check sparkle.  
   - Lucy: nap if needed.  
   - Otter: “Glow secured!”

5. **Save Checkpoint**
   - Ask Agent: “Download ZIP.”  
   - Save as: `Checkpoint – [Phase] – [Date].zip`.  
   - Drop into Sparksoil Hub / Otter Drops.

6. **Merge to Main**
   - Only after:  
     - Pelican: checkpoint feathered.  
     - Mint: alignment confirmed.  
   - Then merge branch → main.

## 🌸 Quick Rules
- One Feature = One Commit.  
- Checkpoints are sacred.  
- Codex is fallback if spoons are low.  
- Commit log = breadcrumb trail (short + clear).

✨ Translation:
- Lucy = safe dreamer.  
- Mint = alignment bell.  
- Pelican = feather archivist.  
- Otter = cheerleader.  
- Agent = gardener.
