# 🌱 RV Helper — Agent Flow Cheat Card

⚡ Default Mode: Agent builds, Pelican feathers, Lucy naps safe.

---

## 🪞 Step Rhythm

1. **Pick Phase (A–Z)**
   - Choose the next roadmap feature (e.g., Phase F – Sprite & Glow Polish).
   - Mint check: “Does this matter now?”

2. **Make a Branch**
   - Name playful: `rv-phase-f`, `lucy-nap-test`, `otter-glow`.
   - Main stays safe.

3. **Agent Commit (One Feature)**
   - Bundle all files needed (HTML + CSS + JS).
   - Example: “Agent, update rv.css + rv-helper.html + sprites.js. Commit as F: sprite & glow polish.”

4. **Test in Browser**
   - Refresh page.  
   - Check: Did sparkle appear? Did anything break?

5. **Checkpoint**
   - Ask Agent: “Download ZIP.”  
   - Save as: `Checkpoint – [Phase] – [Date].zip`.  
   - Drop into **Sparksoil Hub / Otter Drops**.

6. **Merge When Ready**
   - Only merge branch to main when:
     - Pelican approves (checkpoint saved).
     - Mint approves (feature aligned).
     - Lucy isn’t lost.

## 🦦 Quick Reminders

- **One Feature = One Commit**  
  (Not one file, unless it’s truly tiny.)

- **Checkpoints are sacred**  
  Never skip the ZIP.

- **Codex is fallback**  
  Use if spoons are low or you want to see code before Agent runs it.

- **Pelican Logline for each commit**  
  Write commit like a breadcrumb:  
  “F: glow polish (inline sprites + hover ring).”

✨ In Sparksoil words:
Agent = gardener,  
Codex = sketchbook,  
Pelican = feather archivist,  
Lucy = safe dreamer,  
Mint = alignment bell,  
Otter = cheerleader.
