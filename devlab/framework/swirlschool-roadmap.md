# ðŸŒ± Jonahâ€™s Swirl School â€” Agent-First Roadmap

âš¡ Default Mode: Agent builds, Pelican feathers, Lucy naps safe.  
Codex = backup sketchbook if spoons are low.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Principles
- **One Feature = One Commit**  
  Bundle linked HTML + CSS + JS together if they serve the same feature.
- **Branch for each Phase**  
  (`phase-1-core`, `phase-2-swirlfeed`, etc.). Main stays clean.
- **Checkpoint ZIPs**  
  At the end of every Phase:  
  `Checkpoint â€“ [Phase] â€“ [Date].zip`
- **Codex Mode as fallback**  
  Use if you want to copy/paste manually or double-check code before Agent runs.

## ðŸŒ€ Phase Plan

### Phase 1: Core Crumb Logging
- Branch: `phase-1-core`
- Commits:
  1. `index.html + base.css` â†’ dashboard shell
  2. `crumb-entry.js + storage.js` â†’ entry form + JSON/localStorage save
- âœ… Jonah can drop a crumb + see it listed.

---

### Phase 2: Swirlfeed (IG-style scroll)
- Branch: `phase-2-swirlfeed`
- Commits:
  1. `swirlfeed.js + swirlfeed.css` â†’ card layout + scroll feed
- âœ… Jonah sees life in scroll view.

---

### Phase 3: Dayview + Comments
- Branch: `phase-3-dayview`
- Commits:
  1. `dayview.js + dayview.css` â†’ full-day view
  2. Add comment box + PIN-guard logic

### Phase 4: Admin / Grandma View
- Branch: `phase-4-admin`
- Commits:
  1. `admin-dashboard.js + admin.css` â†’ weekly summary + export

### Phase 5: Optional Sparkle Features

---

## ðŸŒ¸ Flow Recap
1. Pick Phase (Aâ€“Z roadmap order).  
2. Create branch (e.g., `phase-2-swirlfeed`).  
3. Hand Agent one clear feature instruction.  
4. Test in browser.  
5. Save checkpoint ZIP.  
6. Merge only after Pelican + Mint approve.

âœ¨ In Sparksoil words:  
Agent is the gardener, Codex is the sketchbook,  
Pelican keeps the feather trail,  
Lucy naps safe,  
Mint checks alignment,  
Otter cheers each sparkle.
