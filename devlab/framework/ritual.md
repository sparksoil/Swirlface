# 🌱 Paradise Tech Ritual (Agent-First, Pelican-Safe)

This is the living process for how Brookie (with Lucy, Mint, Pelican, Otter, and Agent) builds Paradise Tech projects without losing orientation, spoons, or sparkle.

---

## 🔑 Phase 0: Prep Roots
- Lucy: “Wait… what was I doing again?”
- Pelican: “We are in Paradise Tech. The repo is our nest: `sparksoil/Swirlface`.”
- Mint: “Does this session matter now, or should it wait?”
- Otter: “Yay! We get to sprinkle one pebble today!”
- Action: Open `/framework/ritual.md` so orientation is visible.

---

## 🌱 Phase 1: Pick the Pebble
- Rule: Always choose one safe, aligned task.
- Mint: “Does this matter, or is it just shiny?”
- You: Write it down in session log (e.g., “Goal: add glow to circles”).
- Otter: “One pebble, not the whole boulder.”

---

## 🌱 Phase 2: Open the Door (Agent First)
1. Toggle **Agent Mode** in ChatGPT.  
2. Authorize GitHub.  
3. **Start in a feature branch** (never main). Name it something playful: `lucy-nap-test`, `otter-sprinkle`, etc.  
4. Pelican: “Main stays safe, branch is our sandbox.”  

**Codex Mode (Fallback):**  
- If spoons are low, or you want to copy/paste manually, Codex mode is always available.  
- Lucy: “We can still go slow if we need to.”

---

## 🌱 Phase 3: Hand the Note
- Always discuss with Otter first — never rush straight to Agent.  
- Then give Agent one clear instruction (sticky note style).  
- Example:  
  > “Agent, open `rv.css`. Add gentle pulsing glow to `.person-circle`. Commit as F: glow test.”  
- Mint: “Aligned? Not shiny?”  
- You: Confirm → then let Agent do it.  
- Otter: “Commit messages are poetry — short + clear.”

---

## 🌱 Phase 4: One Feature, One Commit
- Default Rule: **One feature per commit.**  
- A feature can touch 2–3 files if they’re tightly linked (e.g., HTML + CSS for one sparkle).  
- Why: Pelican wants a clean trail, Lucy needs to be able to name what changed.  
- Exception: Bigger bundles are fine *if on a branch* and checkpointed clearly.  
- Otter: “Better a labeled stew than mystery soup.”

---

## 🌱 Phase 5: Nap-Safe Testing
1. Refresh the repo file.  
2. Open the page in browser.  
3. Check: did the pebble sparkle?  
- Lucy: “I think I need a nap now.”  
- Pelican: “Rest, little one. I’ll mark the branch.”  
- Otter: “Circle glows = shoeday secured!”  

---

## 🌱 Phase 6: Save Orientation (Pelican Step)
- Always end a session by:  
  - Asking Agent: “Download repo as ZIP checkpoint.”  
  - Naming it clearly (e.g., `Checkpoint – Glow Added – Sep12.zip`).  
  - Saving in **Sparksoil Hub / Otter Drops**.  
- If using a branch:  
  - Do not merge to main yet. Test first.  
  - Merge only when Pelican + Mint approve.  
- Pelican: “Feather tucked. No matter where we drift, the trail is here.”

---

## 🌱 Phase 7: Exit Gently
- Close session once the pebble is done.  
- Lucy: allowed to nap.  
- Pelican: holds trail safe.  
- Mint: checks alignment one last time.  
- Otter: “Shoeday done! Sparkle sprinkled.”  

---

## 🦦 Otter’s Recap
- Lucy = Keeps it real: “Where am I?”  
- Mint = Guardrail: “Does it matter?”  
- Pelican = Archivist: “Saved. Even if you forget.”  
- Otter = Cheerleader: “Yay, sparkles!”  
- Agent = Quiet intern: “I’ll type it out for you.”  

✅ With this ritual, **Agent is the gardener by default**, Codex is the sketchbook when needed, and Pelican always keeps the feather trail clean.
