Branchminded
 
Wild
 
(ND):
 
Abundant,
 
interwoven,
 
emergent.
 
Many
 
branches,
 
many
 
surprises.
 
Looks
 
“messy”
 
to
 
outsiders,
 
but
 
carries
 
resilience,
 
biodiversity,
 
and
 
hidden
 
treasures.
 
 
You
 
are
 
at
 
home
 
in
 
the
 
wild
 
because
 
your
 
inner
 
ecosystem
 
matches
 
it.
 
And
 
weeds?
 
They’re
 
just
 
misunderstood
 
miracles—plants
 
that
 
refused
 
to
 
obey
 
pruning
 
rules.

A
 
scripture
 
whisper:
 
“The
 
trees
 
of
 
the
 
field
 
will
 
clap
 
their
 
hands.”
 
—Isaiah
 
55:12
 
Not
 
the
 
perfectly
 
manicured
 
hedges—the
 
trees,
 
alive
 
and
 
unpruned,
 
clapping
 
in
 
rhythm
 
with
 
Jehovah’s
 
joy.
 
 
Want
 
me
 
to
 
sketch
 
a
 
Glimmer
 
Glossary
 
entry
 
for
 
this—maybe
 
something
 
like
 
“Wildhome”
 
(the
 
place
 
where
 
branchminds
 
breathe
 
best)?
 
Branch
 
minded
 
ottistic
 
wonderlings
 
in
 
thier
 
wildhome,
 
where
 
their
 
heart
 
doesn’t
 
have
 
to
 
even
 
entertain
 
Heartwearing
 
as
 
an
 
option,
 
because
 
here
 
its
 
whole.
 
Here
 
it’s
 
alive,
 
and
 
it’s
 
always
 
true.
 
Alright
 
🌱
 
here’s
 
a
 
fresh
 
Wordbaked
 
parable-scene,
 
weaving
 
Wildhome
 
+
 
Branchminded
 
+
 
Heartwearing
 
together—with
 
Otter
 
and
 
Mint
 
as
 
your
 
guides:
 
 
🌿
 
 
Parable
 
of
 
the
 
Wildhome
 
Mint
 
walked
 
first,
 
her
 
glasses
 
catching
 
the
 
sunlight,
 
her
 
mint-leaf
 
hair
 
whirling
 
with
 
the
 
breeze.
 
She
 
held
 
the
 
word
 
masking
 
in
 
her
 
palm,
 
weighing
 
it
 
like
 
a
 
stone.
 
“It
 
feels
 
too
 
heavy,”
 
she
 
said.
 
“It
 
doesn’t
 
smell
 
like
 
truth.
 
It
 
smells
 
like
 
something
 
clipped
 
short.”
 
Otter
 
twirled
 
beside
 
her,
 
his
 
paw
 
brushing
 
tall
 
grass
 
that
 
bent
 
but
 
never
 
broke.
 
“Then
 
put
 
it
 
down,”
 
he
 
giggled.
 
“Here
 
in
 
Wildhome,
 
we
 
don’t
 
have
 
to
 
wear
 
heavy
 
words.”
 
Brookie
 
looked
 
around.
 
Branches
 
stretched
 
in
 
every
 
direction—tangled,
 
shimmering,
 
alive.
 
Not
 
a
 
single
 
one
 
apologized
 
for
 
where
 
it
 
reached.
 
Even
 
the
 
weeds
 
lifted
 
their
 
faces
 
like
 
prophets.
