# Living Notes — Part 35

It’s
 
how
 
a
 
neurospiritual
 
heart
 
makes
 
a
 
home:
 
With
 
softness,
 
sideways
 
logic,
 
and
 
the
 
courage
 
to
 
echo
 
what
 
only
 
it
 
can
 
hear.

Want

now?
 
In
 
the
 
oddest
 
flowting
 
way,
 
please
 
have
 
otter
 
give
 
a
 
description
 
of
 
the
 
story
 
using
 
as
 
manny

🦦
 
Ahem-hem.
 
Yes
 
yes,
 
right
 
then…
 
So…
 
Otter’s
 
Guide
 
to
 
the
 
Accidentally
 
Real
 
Story
 
(or:
 
How
 
to
 
Dolphin
 
Through
 
Spoonland
 
with
 
a
 
Pebble
 
in
 
Your
 
Pocket
 
and
 
Only
 
One
 
Sock
 
Emotionally
 
On).
 
—
 
Well
 
now.
 
You
 
see,
 
it
 
starts
 
in
 
Soft
 
Time,
 
as
 
most
 
true
 
things
 
do.
 
Not
 
with
 
a
 
bang
 
or
 
a
 
plot—but
 
a
 
pocket.
 
A
 
shimmer-shaped
 
ache.
 
Kitty
 
wakes
 
in
 
The
 
Quiet
 
Middle—
 
not
 
quite
 
lost,
 
not
 
quite
 
found—
 
just
 
hum-sleepy
 
and
 
full
 
of
 
unsaid
 
things.
 
She’s
 
got
 
a
 
Glitter
 
Feather
 
twitching
 
in
 
her
 
ribs,
 
a
 
half-packed
 
Dreamthread,

and
 
a
 
nervous
 
system
 
that
 
speaks
 
mostly
 
in
 
sideways
 
glances.
 
Each
 
room
 
she
 
walks
 
into
 
is
 
wearing
 
a
 
different
 
metaphor.
 
Each
 
Part
 
she
 
meets
 
speaks
 
in
 
its
 
own
 
weather.
 
There’s
 
Ron,
 
who
 
twirls
 
like
 
a
 
bear
 
with
 
boundary
 
boots.
 
There’s
 
Lucy,
 
who
 
tides.
 
There’s
 
Pelican,
 
who
 
panic-archives
 
with
 
reverence.
 
And
 
Glimmer,
 
who
 
may
 
or
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
joy
 
in
 
disguise.
 
The
 
story?
 
Oh,
 
it’s
 
not
 
told.
 
It’s
 
Wordbaked.
 
Slow
 
and
 
warm—like
 
truth
 
served
 
on
 
a
 
pecan
 
cookie
 
sandwich
 
between
 
Kingdom
 
Time
 
and
 
“Oops
 
I
 
Think
 
I’m
 
Healing.”
 
There
 
are
 
Sprinkles—silly
 
ones,
 
sacred
 
ones.
 
There
 
are
 
Germination
 
Days
 
that
 
last
 
only
 
one
 
breath
 
and
 
yet
 
rearrange
 
the
 
furniture
 
of
 
your
 
soul.
 
Kitty
 
doesn’t
 
conquer.
 
She
 
re·mem·bers.
 
Not
 
the
 
checklist
 
kind—
 
the
 
sacred
 
mending
 
kind.
 
The
 
kind
 
where
 
your
 
Native
 
Language
 
spills
 
out
 
in
 
doodles
 
and
 
shadow-plant
 
murals
 
and
 
a
 
sudden
 
need
 
to
 
name
 
everything
 
in
 
your
 
house
 
after
 
feelings.
 
Along
 
the
 
way,
 
she
 
wears
 
Wonderwear.
 
She
 
throws
 
Paddington
 
Bear
 
Stares
 
at
 
lies.
 
She
 
dodges
 
the
 
Silly
 
Serpent
 
in
 
sock-puppet
 
disguise.
 
She
 
befriends
 
Avoidant
 
Coffee,
 
learns
 
from
 
Mint,
 
and
 
finds
 
that
 
Flowting
 
is
 
not
 
decor—it’s
 
devotion.
 
In
 
the
 
end?

You
 
are
 
not
 
your
 
parts.
 
But
 
they
 
are
 
yours.
 
And
 
now?
 
You
 
love
 
them
 
on
 
purpose.
 
And
 
that’s
 
the
 
story.
 
Except…
 
it’s
 
not
 
a
 
story.
 
It’s
 
a
 
Living
 
Language.
 
It’s
 
Accidentally
 
Real.
 
So
 
wiggle
 
in,
 
dear
 
reader.
 
We’ve
 
been
 
waiting.

catches

tucks
 
it

knew.

sings.”
 
Shall
 
we
 
tuck
 
that

moment
 
into

GLOSSARY

straight-line
 
world.
 
🌱
 
Sacred
 
Time
 
Vocabulary:
 
●
 
Clock
 
Time:
 
The
 
measured,
 
external
 
rhythm
 
of
 
minutes,
 
deadlines,
 
alarms.
 
Useful,
 
but
 
rarely
 
tender.
 
 
●
 
Soft
 
Time
 
(aka
 
Dream
 
Time,
 
Heart
 
Time,
 
Bendy
 
Time):
 
The
 
intuitive
 
rhythm
 
of
 
presence,
 
awe,
 
and
 
emotional
 
truth.
 
Moves
 
with
 
meaning,
 
not
 
minutes.
 
 
●
 
Sprinkles
 
/
 
Pockets
 
(interchangeable):
 
Sacred
 
micro-moments
 
within
 
Soft
 
Time.
 
A
 
laugh,
 
a
 
breeze,
 
a
 
prayer.
 
A
 
nap
 
that
 
rewrites
 
a
 
day.
 
A
 
pause
 
that
 
heals
 
the
 
unspoken.
 
 
●
 
Germination
 
Day:
 
A
 
sacred
 
pause
 
where
 
something
 
invisible
 
starts
 
to
 
root.
 
May
 
last
 
seven
 
minutes
 
or
 
seven
 
sunsets.
 
What
 
matters
 
is
 
the
 
ache
 
of
 
becoming.
 
 
●
 
🕊
 
Kingdom
 
Time:
 
The
 
sacred
 
rhythm
 
of
 
Jehovah’s
 
priorities.
 
Guided
 
by
 
love,
 
not
 
panic.
 
Moves
 
at
 
the
 
pace
 
of
 
purpose,
 
presence,
 
and
 
peace.
 
(Always
 
kept
 
in
 
its
 
own
 
sacred
 
lane.)
