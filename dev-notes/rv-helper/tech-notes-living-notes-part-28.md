and
 
whispered
 
rules
 
like:
 
“No
 
thinking
 
in
 
straight
 
lines
 
allowed!”
 
and
 
“Only
 
twirly
 
snacks
 
past
 
this
 
point.”
 
Kitty
 
didn’t
 
always
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
explain
 
what
 
made
 
something
 
feel
 
safe,
 
but
 
Otter
 
usually
 
knew
 
first.
 
He
 
always
 
brought
 
the
 
pebble.
 
She
 
always
 
brought
 
the
 
sparkle
 
sticker.
 
And
 
together,
 
they
 
made
 
the
 
rules
 
softer.
 
 
Somewhere
 
around
 
then,
 
a
 
grown-up
 
said
 
“autistic.”
 
Kitty
 
tilted
 
her
 
head.
 
She
 
thought
 
they
 
said
 
“Ottistic.”
 
And
 
honestly?
 
That
 
felt
 
better.
 
She
 
didn’t
 
know
 
exactly
 
what
 
it
 
meant—
 
but
 
it
 
sounded
 
like
 
twirls.
 
Like
 
pebble
 
pockets,
 
and
 
sideways
 
thoughts,
 
and
 
thinking
 
in
 
colors
 
instead
 
of
 
steps.

It
 
didn’t
 
feel
 
like
 
a
 
label.
 
It
 
felt
 
like…
 
a
 
name.
 
A
 
best
 
friend.
 
And
 
secretly,
 
quietly,
 
she
 
liked
 
it.
 
 
At
 
school,
 
they
 
gave
 
her
 
a
 
plate.
 
“A
 
keepsake!”
 
the
 
teacher
 
beamed.
 
“Draw
 
your
 
best
 
picture—your
 
family
 
will
 
keep
 
it
 
forever.”
 
Kitty
 
wanted
 
to
 
draw
 
something
 
wonderful.
 
So
 
she
 
looked
 
around.
 
Rainbows.
 
Puppies.
 
Families
 
under
 
trees.
 
Each
 
picture
 
tidy.
 
One
 
idea.
 
But
 
Kitty’s
 
head
 
was
 
a
 
full-blown
 
Kitebrain—
 
colors,
 
ideas,
 
and
 
tugging
 
truths
 
all
 
flapping
 
against
 
each
 
other
 
in
 
the
 
wind.
 
She
 
couldn’t
 
pick
 
just
 
one.
 
So
 
she
 
drew
 
all
 
of
 
them.
 
A
 
rainbow—line.
 
A
 
puppy—line.

A
 
house,
 
a
 
tree,
 
hearts
 
and
 
hugs—line.
 
line.
 
line.
 
“Are
 
you
 
sure
 
that’s
 
what
 
you
 
want,
 
Kitty?”
 
the
 
teacher
 
asked,
 
kindly
 
confused.
 
“I’ve
 
seen
 
you
 
draw
 
prettier
 
pictures
 
than
 
that.”
 
Kitty
 
nodded.
 
“Yes,”
 
she
 
whispered.
 
Because
 
it
 
was
 
all
 
she
 
could
 
manage.
 
But
 
inside,
 
something
 
wobbled.
 
Like
 
a
 
pebble
 
knocked
 
loose.
 
And
 
when
 
she
 
looked
 
for
 
Otter
 
that
 
night…
 
he
 
was
 
gone.
 
Not
 
gone-gone.
 
Just…
 
quiet.
 
Like
 
something
 
had
 
been
 
folded
 
up
 
and
 
tucked
 
into
 
a
 
Pelican
 
Pocket.
 
 
Time
 
passed.
 
She
 
laughed
 
when
 
she
 
wasn’t
 
sure
 
why.
 
She
 
tucked
 
away
 
the
 
colors
 
that
 
didn’t
 
quite
 
match.
 
She
 
worked
 
hard
 
to
 
become
 
Meeting
 
Ready.
 
But
 
the
 
ache
 
in
 
her
 
chest
 
stayed.
 
She
 
missed
 
something,
 
but
 
she
 
didn’t
 
know
 
what.
 
Until
 
one
 
very
 
normal
 
Wednesday,
 
at
 
a
 
very
 
non-sparkley
 
time
 
of
 
day,
 
Kitty
 
found
 
herself
 
on
 
the
 
bathroom
 
floor.
