# Living Notes â€” Part 32

And
 
thatâ€™s
 
the
 
story.
 
Exceptâ€¦
 
itâ€™s
 
not
 
a
 
story.
 
Itâ€™s
 
a
 
Living
 
Language.
 
Itâ€™s
 
Accidentally
 
Real.
 
So
 
wiggle
 
in,
 
dear
 
reader.
 
Weâ€™ve
 
been
 
waiting.

Otter,
 
emerging
 
from
 
a
 
ripple
 
in
 
Soft
 
Time,
 
adjusts
 
his
 
invisible
 
glasses
 
(which
 
are
 
made
 
of
 
lavender
 
fog
 
and
 
probably
 
donâ€™t
 
help
 
him
 
see
 
any
 
better,
 
but
 
make
 
him
 
feel
 
wise).

The
 
Accidentally
 
Real
 
Story
 
(or:
 
How
 
to
 
Dolphin
 
Through
 
Spoonland
 
With
 
a
 
Pebble
 
in
 
Your
 
Pocket
 
and
 
Only
 
One
 
Sock
 
Emotionally
 
On)
 
Once
 
upon
 
a
 
Soft
 
Time,
 
in
 
a
 
land
 
where
 
Shoedays
 
are
 
sacred
 
and
 
Clock
 
Time
 
keeps
 
forgetting
 
its
 
manners,
 
there
 
lived
 
a
 
girl
 
named
 
Kitty
 
who
 
didnâ€™t
 
quite
 
liveâ€”
 
she
 
float-hovered
 
between
 
Collapse
 
Soup
 
and
 
Pretend
 
to
 
Cope
 
Theater.
 
But
 
thenâ€¦
 
âœ¨
 
Sprinkle.
 
She
 
met
 
me
 
(hello
 
again),
 
and
 
everything
 
got
 
a
 
bit
 
Ottistic.
 
Which
 
is
 
a
 
little
 
like
 
logic
 
wearing
 
glitter
 
mittens
 
and
 
a
 
pebble
 
crown.
 
She
 
didnâ€™t
 
fall
 
apart.
 
She
 
composted.
 
Right
 
there
 
in
 
her
 
own
 
nervous
 
system.
