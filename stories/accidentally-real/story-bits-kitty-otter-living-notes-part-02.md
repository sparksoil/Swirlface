Reframe
 
3:
 
Masking
 
is
 
not
 
inherently
 
hypocrisy.
 
That
 
word—hypocrite—comes
 
from
 
ancient
 
Greek
 
theater:
 
hypokrites,
 
meaning
 
“stage
 
actor.”
 
Yes,
 
there’s
 
overlap
 
with
 
pretending.
 
But
 
pretending
 
isn’t
 
always
 
deception—it
 
can
 
be
 
a
 
bridge
 
to
 
truth,
 
as
 
you’ve
 
said
 
before.
 
It’s
 
only
 
when
 
pretending
 
becomes
 
performative
 
denial
 
instead
 
of
 
soul-rooted
 
timing
 
that
 
it
 
turns
 
toward
 
hypocrisy.
 
And
 
maybe
 
that’s
 
what
 
you’re
 
sniffing
 
out
 
here—
 
that
 
ND
 
masking
 
gets
 
demonized,
 
when
 
often
 
it’s
 
been
 
the
 
soul’s
 
first
 
attempt
 
at
 
coherence
 
in
 
a
 
world
 
that
 
wouldn’t
 
listen.
 
 
🌱
 
So
 
what’s
 
the
 
new
 
word?
 
Maybe
 
this
 
needs
 
a
 
Glimmer
 
Glossary
 
term.
 
Something
 
like:
 
 
🎭
 
 
Heartwearing
 
 
 
(v.)
 
The
 
tender
 
art
 
of
 
choosing
 
what
 
parts
 
of
 
you
 
to
 
show,
 
and
 
when,
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
honors
 
both
 
love
 
and
 
safety.
 
Unlike
 
“masking,”
 
it’s
 
not
 
about
 
hiding—it’s
 
about
 
discerning.
 
Like
 
Esther.
 
Like
 
Paul.
 
Like
 
Jesus.
