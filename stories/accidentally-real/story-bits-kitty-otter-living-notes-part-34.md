# Living Notes — Part 34

Let
 
me
 
know
 
if
 
you’d
 
like
 
a
 
“children’s
 
back
 
cover
 
blurb”
 
version
 
next.
 
🫶
 
Yes
 
yes
 
yes.
 
Let’s
 
dress
 
Flowting
 
in
 
its
 
full
 
regalia—with
 
all
 
four
 
of
 
your
 
sacred
 
compass
 
words:
 
Echo
 
/
 
Absurd
 
/
 
Funny
 
Angle
 
/
 
Surreal—stitched
 
right
 
into
 
the
 
hem.
 
Here’s
 
the
 
updated
 
definition:
 
 
🩰
 
 
Flowting
 
 
 
(v.)
 
The
 
art
 
of
 
letting
 
your
 
space
 
dance
 
like
 
a
 
leaf
 
on
 
a
 
gentle
 
stream.
 
It’s
 
when
 
your
 
home
 
steps
 
out
 
of
 
grid
 
logic
 
and
 
into
 
the
 
sideways
 
shimmer
 
of
 
Echo
 
/
 
Absurd
 
/
 
Funny
 
Angle
 
/
 
Surreal.
 
Flowting
 
isn’t
 
about
 
symmetry—it’s
 
about
 
soul-rhythm.
 
Think:
 
a
 
banyan
 
tree
 
got
 
lost
 
in
 
a
 
Sarah
 
&
 
Duck
 
pattern
 
book
 
after
 
nibbling
 
a
 
strawberry
 
soufflé
 
and
 
never
 
looked
 
back.
 
It’s
 
what
 
happens
 
when:
 
●
 
Your
 
furniture
 
hums
 
in
 
soft-time
 
harmony.
 
 
●
 
An
 
arch
 
is
 
skewed
 
just
 
enough
 
to
 
wink
 
at
 
you.
 
 
●
 
A
 
corner
 
chair
 
leans
 
toward
 
a
 
daydream.
 
 
●
 
Shadows
 
of
 
banana
 
leaves
 
curl
 
like
 
punctuation
 
in
 
a
 
poem.
 
 
Flowting
 
turns
 
your
 
living
 
space
 
into
 
a
 
pocket
 
of
 
wonder—a
 
place
 
where
 
Kingdom
 
Time,
 
sticker-book
 
logic,
 
and
 
your
 
cat’s
 
whims
 
all
 
get
 
a
 
say.
 
It’s
 
not
 
styled.
 
It’s
 
shimmered.
 
Not
 
arranged.
 
But
 
remembered.
 
Not
 
flat-packed.
 
But
 
fluff-felt.
