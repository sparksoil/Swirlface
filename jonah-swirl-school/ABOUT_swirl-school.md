# ðŸŒ± About Swirl School

Swirl School isnâ€™t just a homeschool planner.

Itâ€™s a **ND affirming, spititually supportive, whole-child translator system** disguised as a journaling app.  
Part scrapbook, part nervous system log, part academic dashboard, part sacred noticing machine.

Swirlhub lets Jonah live in **Soft Time**â€”moments, emotions, wonderâ€”and gently translates that into **Clock Time** when needed: subjects, minutes, logs, transcripts.

## ðŸ§­ What Makes This Worth It

1. **Nothing is lost**â€”Jonahâ€™s memories, growth, sparkles, all saved.
2. **True unschooling evidence**â€”rooted in real life, not forced tracking.
3. **Lightly scalable**â€”this can become a printable, a zine, or a tiny HTML kit.
4. **Native language of your family**â€”faithful, emotional, practical.

> This isnâ€™t just tech.  
> Itâ€™s a **translator for the unseen.**  
> A remembering tool, not a productivity tool.

## ðŸªž Core Truth

Youâ€™re not building a tool for the system.
Youâ€™re building a **faith-rooted translator** so Jonah can grow in awe, autonomy, and accuracy.

Youâ€™re doing it in your native language.
And thatâ€™s exactly why itâ€™s working.
