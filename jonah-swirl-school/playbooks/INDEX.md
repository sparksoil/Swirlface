# Playbooks: Table of Contents (INDEX)

## 1) Full Playbook List for Swirl School Agent

### Core Build
1. **SwirlHub-Home.md**  
   Spiral art at center, floating tokens, dismissible instructions, footer links.  
   (You partly handled this in AGENTS.md polish, but giving it a playbook makes the hub reproducible.)

2. **SwirlFeed-IG.md** (already created)  
   Instagram-style feed: scroll, stories row, post cards, comments/likes, jump to Day.

3. **DayJournal-Comments.md**  
   Stacked daily entries, text comments, calm states; later add photo crumbs.

4. **Sprites-Growth.md**  
   Seed → sprout → bud → bloom sprites per pillar. Growth counters stored in storage.js.
