**Playbooks: Table of Contents (INDEX)**

1) Full Playbook List for Swirl School Agent

Core Build
	1.	SwirlHub-Home.md
Spiral art at center, floating tokens, dismissible instructions, footer links.
(You partly handled this in AGENTS.md polish, but giving it a playbook makes the hub reproducible.)
	2.	SwirlFeed-IG.md (already created)
Instagram-style feed: scroll, stories row, post cards, comments/likes, jump to Day.
	3.	DayJournal-Comments.md
Stacked daily entries, text comments, calm states; later add photo crumbs.
	4.	Sprites-Growth.md
Seed → sprout → bud → bloom sprites per pillar. Growth counters stored in storage.js.

⸻

Planning + Evidence
	5.	Weekly-Blooms.md
Weekly overview with bars/blooms visualizing progress.
	6.	Evidence-Pack.md
Generate subject logs (soft → clock tags). Export clean Grandma-friendly reports.
	7.	Grandma-Plan.md
Neutral, printable weekly/monthly planning page.

⸻

Translator Layer
	8.	Translator-Map.md
Define JSON map of soft tags → subjects. Ensure every crumb/reflection resolves.

⸻

Polish / Theme
	9.	Theme-Palette.md
Apply Palette.md tokens consistently; remove stray hex codes; ensure a11y contrast.
	10.	Instructions-Helper.md
Style and reuse dismissible helper cards across pages.

⸻

Extensions (Optional Toggles)
	11.	PinGuard.md
Lock tasks behind PIN for adult oversight.
	12.	Lightbox-Gallery.md
Crumb photos open in swipeable lightbox.
	13.	HashRouting.md
Deep-link into crumb/day using #date.

⸻

Final QA
	14.	Accessibility-Sweep.md
Labels, tab order, focus states, reduced-motion.
	15.	BringUp-Smoke.md (already exists as checklist)
Quick sanity pass after any change.
	16.	Acceptance-Feed.md (already exists as checklist)
Acceptance criteria for IG feed.

⸻

✨ So the minimal must-have playbooks are:
	•	SwirlHub
	•	SwirlFeed IG (done)
	•	DayJournal Comments
	•	Sprites Growth
	•	Weekly Blooms
	•	Evidence Pack
	•	Grandma Plan
	•	Translator Map

The rest are polish/optional toggles/final QA.

2) Next Step

Since you said yes: the next draft will be DayJournal-Comments.md in the same “paste-ready” structure as your IG one (Files → Why → Steps → Acceptance).

👉 Do you want me to scope that as text comments only (now) with a note for photo crumbs later, or should I include both in the playbook right away?
