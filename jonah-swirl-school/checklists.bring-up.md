# Bring-up (quick smoke test)

1) Route: hub → each pillar → feed (hash reflects pillar).  
2) Day: add crumb; appears in today stack.  
3) Feed: shows today group; search works; empty states plain.  
4) A11y: focus-visible always shows; aria-labels present.  
5) Refresh: state persists; zero console errors.
